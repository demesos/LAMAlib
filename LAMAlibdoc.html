Version: 0.13<br>
Date: 2020-09-16<br>
Author: Wil Elmenreich (wilfried at gmx dot at)<br>

<br>
<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>
To use LAMAlib you need to have cc65 installed. Get it at https://cc65.github.io<br>
<br>
<h3>Possibility 1: Install in cc65</h3>
<ul><li>Copy all LAMAlib*.inc files into directory <tt>asminc</tt> of your cc65 installation.<br>
<li>Copy the file LAMAlib.lib into directory <tt>lib</tt> of your cc65 installation.<br>
<li>Move LAMAlibdoc.html (the file you are currently viewing) either to the html directory of cc65 or to some other place where you want to conveniently keep the documentation.<br>
</ul>You don't need to keep the original folder of LAMAlib<br>
<br>
<br>
In your programs,<br>
<ul><li>add a line <tt>.include "LAMAlib.inc"</tt> at the top of your assembler file<br>
<li>assemble with command <tt>cl65 yourprog.s -lib LAMAlib.lib -C c64-asm.cfg -u __EXEHDR__ -o yourprog.prg</tt>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Possibility 2: Keep LAMAlib separately</h3>
Keep a copy of the LAMAlib folder in a sister directory of your project.<br>
<br>
In your programs,<br>
<ul><li>add a line <tt>.include "../LAMAlib/LAMAlib.inc"</tt> at the top of your assembler file (the forward slash works on Linux as well as on Linux systems)<br>
<li>assemble with command <tt>cl65 yourprog.s -lib ../LAMAlib/LAMAlib.lib -C c64-asm.cfg -u __EXEHDR__ -o yourprog.prg</tt>
<li>when you publish source code of your project you can add LAMAlib to the package. The license of LAMAlib has been chosen to be maximum permissive, so whatever project you have, there should be no problems adding the code.<br>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Points to remember</h2>
Please note that the zero flag for 16/24/32 bit operations is not properly set for most macros except CMP. For example after a 16 bit calculation, a CMPAX #00 is be necessary to test for zero.<br>
Some of the more complex functions like division and multiplication use zero page addresses $22-$2a as temporary memory. This area is also used by BASIC for temporary ptrs and results, but borrowing these addresses seem not to interfere severely with the system. Using $22-2A further plays well with cc65 parts written in C and leaves the well-known free ZP addresses at $FB to $FE to the user.<br>

<h2>Structured Programming</h2>
These commands allow you to use constructs like <i>if .. else .. endif</i>, <i>do...loop</i>, <i>for...next</i>, and <i>switch...case</i> in assembly language! The structures can even be nested. The implementation of these structures is basically as efficient as a a handcoded composure of branches, jumps as labels, while it is much easier to write and read.<br>
All macros can be nested.<br>
<br>
<b>store <i>reg</i></b><br>
Generates self-modifying code for store/recall of a register<br>
Registers can be A,X,Y, or AX (that is A and X)<br>
An example application for <i>store</i>/<i>recall</i> is for saving a register to be able use it in between. An alternative to <i>store</i>/<i>recall</i> are stack push/pull, which is more compact, but 1 cycle slower.<br>
Each store must match with exactly one <i>recall</i> macro using the same register, recall has to be placed later in your code<br>
Registers modified: none<br>
<br>
<b>recall <i>reg</i></b><br>
Generates the code for recalling a stored register<br>
Registers can be A,X,Y, or AX (that is A and X)<br>
Each recall must match with exactly one preceding <i>store</i> macro using the same register<br>
Registers modified: the recalled register<br>
<br>
<b>if <i>cond</i></b><br>
...<br>
[<b>else</b>]<br>
...<br>
<b>endif</b><br>
Structure for conditionals.<br>
<i>cond</i> can be <i>eq</i>, <i>neq</i>, <i>minus</i>, <i>plus</i>, <i>c_clr</i>, <i>c_set</i>, <i>v_clr</i>, <i>v_set</i>, <i>lt</i>, <i>ge</i><br>
This corresponds to assembler commands BEQ, BNE, BMI, BPL, BCC, BCS, BVC, BVS<br>
<i>lt</i> (less than) is equal to <i>c_clr</i> (BCC), <i>ge</i> (greater or equal) is equal to <i>c_set</i> (BCS)<br>
using else is optional<br>
Registers modified: none<br>
<br>
<b>for <i>X|Y|A|AX|addr,start,to|downto,end,step</i></b><br>
...<br>
<b>next</b><br>
For loop structure<br>
Counting variable can be an 8-bit register (A,X,Y), a 16 bit register (AX) or a 16 bit memory address (in parentheses)<br>
<i>start</i> can be a constant or a memory address pointing to the value<br>
<i>end</i> can be a constant or a memory address pointing to the value. The loop is continued including an iteration reaching the <i>end</i> value<br>
<i>start</i> can be a constant or a memory address pointing to the value<br>
<b>to</b> indicates a loop that counts up, <b>downto</b> indicates a loop that counts down<br>
<i>end</i> can be a constant or a memory address pointing to the value<br>
<b>step</b> is optional and defines the increment/decrement (default=1). This value is alway positive, counting down is indicated with <b>downto</b><br>
<br>
When the loop variable is an 8 bit register, <i>start</i>, <i>end</i>, and <i>step</i> are a single byte (or a memory reference to a single byte)<br>
When the loop variable is a 16 bit register (AX) or a 16 bit memory address, <i>start</i>, <i>end</i>, and <i>step</i> are a 16 bit value (or a memory reference to a 16 bit value)<br>
If memory references can also go to zero page the zero page addressing mode is used which speeds up the code a bit<br>
When <i>step</i> is larger than 1 or no constant, loops that count down can are limited to a 7 bit (for single register loops) or a 15 bit range<br>
It is possible to nest multiple for loops but each <b>for</b> must be followed by exactly one corresponding <i>next</i> later in the code.<br>
<br>
Within a for loop, the macros <i>break</i> and <i>continue</i> can be used to exit the loop or go to next iteration.<br>
<br>
Registers modified: the loop register, or the accu otherwise<br>

<br>
<b>do</b><br>
...<br>
<b>until</b>|<b>while</b> <i>cond</i><br>
...<br>
<b>loop</b> [<b>until</b>|<b>while</b> <i>cond</i>]<br>
Defines a loop that is exit based on a while or until condition<br>
<i>cond</i> can be <i>eq</i>, <i>neq</i>, <i>minus</i>, <i>plus</i>, <i>c_clr</i>, <i>c_set</i>, <i>v_clr</i>, <i>v_set</i>, <i>lt</i>, <i>ge</i><br>
This corresponds to assembler commands BEQ, BNE, BMI, BPL, BCC, BCS, BVC, BVS<br>
<i>lt</i> (less than) is equal to <i>c_clr</i> (BCC), <i>ge</i> (greater or equal) is equal to <i>c_set</i> (BCS)<br>
<b>until</b> and <b>while</b> can be used on a seperate line or after <b>loop</b><br>
There can be any number of <b>until</b> or <b>while</b> conditions, also none, which defines an endless loop<br>
Within a do...loop, the macros <i>break</i> and <i>continue</i> can be used to exit the loop or go to next iteration.<br>
